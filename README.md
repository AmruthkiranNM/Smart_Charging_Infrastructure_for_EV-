# ⚡ Smart EV Charging Infrastructure for India
### Dynamically Optimizing Load to Improve Charging Efficiency  
> **Aligned with SDG 7 (Affordable & Clean Energy) & SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities & Communities)**

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption is accelerating in India, but the charging infrastructure often faces **uneven power distribution**, leading to:

- ⚠️ Long charging times  
- ⚠️ Power grid stress during peak hours  
- ⚠️ Underutilized energy during off-peak times  

This project proposes a **Smart Charging Infrastructure** that dynamically manages load and optimizes energy use through:

- 🔄 Real-time load balancing  
- ⚡ Demand-based smart scheduling  
- 🌞 Integration of renewable energy sources  
- 📊 Predictive analytics for grid optimization

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ⚡ Reduce EV charging time by up to 30%  
- 🔋 Ensure uniform power distribution across charging stations  
- 🌍 Promote clean energy use in urban transportation  
- 🏙️ Support development of smart, sustainable cities
